### My Passions: 
## Coding🖥️, Music 🎵, Gym 💪🏾, Games 🕹️

Hey, I'm Wilmer! My background in Psychology stemmed from my deep interest in learning how our minds worked: learning about all the different parts coming together to create an intricate system, us as people! This curiosity instilled in me since a young kid, constantly asking my parents how things worked and why, has developed into a passion for uncovering the underlying mechanisms allowing something to exist. This has made learning how to code a life-changing experience, as I now know I can work with something I love. I'm always looking to learn more and improve in every way, especially when it comes to code. 

🔭 I’m currently working on my full-stack e-commerce web-application: Squishmazon

When I'm not coding, you can catch me at the gym, spending time with loved ones, or playing games when I have some downtime.
